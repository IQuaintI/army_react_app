# Homepage Outline

## Introduction

For this project we want to create a website that can display multiple sources of information regarding the Army. 

This means we are going to need a homepage that will display all the information we want to show and allow links to it.

## Requirements

- Create a header that will display at the top of the page
- Create a sub-header that will display under the header
- Create a list of buttons that will display under the sub-header. These buttons are going to accordion to show more information when clicked.
- The information that is displayed when the button is clicked will be a list of links that will take you to the information you want to see.
- The accordion tile cards will be able to be closed by clicking the button again.
- There will be a footer that will display at the bottom of the page.

## Design

- The webpage background color has yet to be determined, but the native white is too bright so that will at least be dialed back (potentially gray or dark blue).
- The header will be a color that contrasts the background color so as to be easily seen along with the sub-header.
- The buttons will de displayed in a grid format with a set number of buttons per row.
- The buttons will have images over them that will be relevant to the information they will display.
- Alter the font and font size to be more appealing to the eye.

## Implementation

- This whole affair should use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- We might be importing a library to help with the accordion effect.
- We also might be using a library to help with the grid layout, but that should be doable in just CSS.
- Might import a font-size library to help with the font size.
